    "# Exercise 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise 2 includes a **written assignment** (10 points), a **programming assignment with 6 problems** (9 points) and a **feedback/workload assessment assignment** (1 point). For each problem you need to modify the notebook by adding your own programming solutions or written text. Remember to save and commit your changes locally, and push your changes to GitHub after each major change! Regular commits will help you to keep track of your changes (and revert them if needed). Pushing your work to GitHub will ensure that you don't lose any work in case your computer crashes (can happen!).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Completing this exercise takes approximately: 12-16 hours** (based on previous year statistics). However, the time it takes can vary significantly from student to student, so we **recommended that you start immediately working on the exercise to avoid issues meeting with the deadline**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Due date\n",
    "\n",
    "You should submit (push) your Exercise answers to your personal Github repository **by Friday 30.1**. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: Once you have submitted your exercise to Github, we can see and grade them. Thus, you do not need to submit your answers to anywhere else.*\n",
    "      \n",
    "### Start your exercise in CSC Noppe\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can start programming, you need to launch the CSC Notebook instance and clone your **personal copy of the Exercise repository** (i.e. something like `exercise-2-htenkanen`) there using Git. If you need help with this, [read the documentation on the course site](https://sustainability-gis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/git-basics.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are documents that can be used and run inside the JupyterLab programming environment (e.g. at [noppe.csc.fi](https://noppe.csc.fi/)) containing the computer code and rich text elements (such as text, figures, tables and links). \n",

    "## The responsible use of AI tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools based on large language models (LLMs), such as Aalto AI, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude or DeepL, are changing the ways in which people produce content including software and written text. Although these tools have great potential to expidite many writing and coding tasks, it is important to note that one must take full responsibility of the content: I.e. you must take the full ownership of the written essay as well as understand the code that is produced in order to ensure it functions properly. \n",
    "\n",
    "### AI use in the Written assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "You should write the essay based on your own thoughts and literature/materials provided during the course or which you have found independently (remember citing your sources). This means that you should **not** use AI for generating your essay. However, AI can be used for brainstorming and language check (preferably [Aalto AI](https://ai.aalto.fi/)). If you use AI in any form, you should acknowledge it and explain how you used the AI at the end of notebook under \"Acknowledgements\" section (located at the end of the Notebook). In the acknowledgements, you should mention 1) the tools that you used to support your writing, 2) to which purpose were they used for, and 3) what prompts you used when using the AI tools. In case we identify the use of AI without proper acknowledgment, we will mark 0 points for the essay. \n",

    "\n",
    "If you use AI in any form when doing the programming exercises, you should acknowledge it and explain how you used the AI at the \"Acknowledgements\" section (located at the end of the Notebook). In the acknowledgements, you should mention 1) the tools that you used to support your coding, 2) to which purpose were they used for (e.g. which problems/tasks), and 3) what prompts you used when using the AI tools. In case we identify the use of AI without proper acknowledgment, we will mark 0 points for the programming parts. "

    "In this exercise, we will practice network analysis and spatial accessibility modelling. Our overall goal is to analyze healthcare accessibility by conducting a two-step floating catchment area analysis in Helsinki Region. We will calculate travel time-based catchment areas by public transport (30 minutes threshold) from healthcare facilities (Health stations, University hospitals and City hospitals) located in the area to  population grid cells (250 meter resolution) in the Helsinki Region. Based on the population information and the number of physicians at given hospital (simulated --> not real), we can calculate an accessibility index based on 2SFCA method. The end result should look something like following:\n",

    "**Task 6.1** Calculate catchment areas from population centers. In this task, you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the travel times from all population centers (`pop_centroids`) to healthcare facilities (i.e. the data stored in `hospitals` GeoDataFrame). Note: It will take a bit longer to calculate these. \n",
    "   - Follow the same approach as in **Problem 4, Task 4.1** and calculate the travel times by public transport+walking using the following departure time: 7:30 am on January 19th, 2023. The `origins` should be population centroids and the `destinations` should be the hospitals. \n",
    "   - **Important**: As we want to calculate the 30-minute catchment areas, you need to specify the maximum travel time from the origin by using `max_time` parameter. You can specify this cut-off value by adding following argument to the TravelTimeMatrixComputer: `max_time=datetime.timedelta(seconds=30*60)`\n",
    "   - Store the results in a variable called `times_from_population_centers`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hint:** Save your travel time matrix DataFrame into a CSV file so that you can use it later and save time (you can skip the r5py calculations and directly read the travel times from CSV). Read Chapter 3.1 from https://pythongis.org for details about how to [Write a CSV file](https://pythongis.org/part1/chapter-03/nb/00-pandas-basics.html#writing-data-to-a-file) and how to [Read a CSV file](https://pythongis.org/part1/chapter-03/nb/00-pandas-basics.html#reading-tabular-data).\n",
